# shadely-bot

A simple discort bot. Using this bot, you can play audio from a youtube link, and the bot will automatically download audio from the link and queue the song up in a list of songs. You can manage this queue and the bot is capable of orperating in multiple discord servers.

## TODO:

- TODO: Make it possible to post audio files in a discord message and have the bot pick it up and play it.
- TODO: Register users names in simple json to start, and track their decisions. (GAME FUNCTIONALITY TABLED FOR NOW, PUT THIS ON BACKBURNER)
- TODO: Clean up the code. It's filthy. Just filthy.
